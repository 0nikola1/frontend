# Vite

Vite is a new type of compiler that compiles each file as they come in.

## Running Vite

- Checkout this branch
- `yarn`
- Run `script/develop` until it finishes first webpack build. Then turn it off. We use this right now to prepare the static files + auth/onboarding pages.
- Update `hass_frontend/index.html`, find where we import the scripts and replace with:
  ```html
  <script>
    // Define in vite config doesn't work.
    window.__DEV__ = true;
    window.__DEMO__ = false;
    window.__BACKWARDS_COMPAT__ = false;
    window.__BUILD__ = "latest";
    window.__VERSION__ = "dev";
    // Temporary to stop an error
    document.adoptedStyleSheets = [];
    // Load scripts from Vite dev server
    import("http://localhost:3000/src/entrypoints/core.ts");
    import("http://localhost:3000/src/entrypoints/app.ts");
  ```
  If Vite transforms would work correctly, we would just have to drop the "use-credentials" part in dev and update the import URLs to import from Vite dev server.
- Start vite `vite serve -c build-scripts/vite/vite.config.ts`
- Open Home Assistant as usual.
